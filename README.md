# Axway - API Gateway Helm Chart

As with many kubernetes solutions, we use helm to manage the deployment of the API Gateway infrastructure. Helm is a very powerful tool that uses a management structure, that it refers to as charts, to define the resources you want to deploy to your kubernetes cluster. These resources can then be parameterized to enable easy configuration and customization from a single location. Charts can also be divided into subcharts in the event that some resources may only need to be deployed under certain criteria. While helm notably simplifies the deployment and management of artifacts in a kubernetes cluster, some familiarity with kubernetes, it's basic tools and the resources it uses would be desirable in order to correctly understand what a helm chart does and to be able to troubleshoot in the event of any issues.

The Helm Chart provided here contains all the kubernetes manifest files required to run the API Gateway in Kubernetes. This includes deployment of Admin Node Manager, API Manager UI and API Gateway Traffic containers as well as configuring an external MySQL database should it be present. These charts should be able to deploy on most clusters regardless of where it is running. However these charts do not include artifacts such as LoadBalancers or Ingress Controllers that allow external connection to the cluster. This is because these artifacts are different depending on the platform you are running on. Port-forwarding can be configured to validate the services and cluster without these external connections being configured.

## Prerequisites
As stated some familiarity with kubernetes tools is required as well as knowledge of the gateway setup such as FED configuration. 
- Kubectl installed
- Kubernetes cluster built - we use kops to build our clusters in AWS but this chart should work on any cluster, regardless of how it should be built.
- FED configured - FED should be configured using policy studio. Some of the settings, such as Cassandra and MySQL need to match the variables provided to the helm charts. More info below
- Images built using EMT Scripts and pushed to your Docker Registry
- Helm installed and initialized
- Cassandra Cluster configured
- (Optional) MySQL Configured

### values.yaml
Most, if not all of the variables you need to set are defined in values.yaml. This simplifies configuration as it should allow all changes to be made in a single location. The defaults for most of these variables should suit most use cases, particularly when first getting up and running, and will only need to be changed in specific cases. However there are some variables that are required to be set by each user as they will be unique to that setup. These are listed in the order they appear in the values.yaml file:

**global.dockerRegistry:** This is the address of your docker registry, where all your images should be stored.

**namespace:** The namespace that you chart will be deployed into. This needs to be created before you deploy your chart.

**apigw.imageTag:** The tag for the Admin Node Manager and API Gateway images. We use a common tag for these images as this ensures that they match.

**anm.imageName:** The Admin Node Manager image name. This needs to match the image that is in your docker registry.

**apimgmt.imageName:** The API Gateway image name. The same image is used for API Manager UI and the API Gateway Traffic, but different ports are exposed. For this reason this variable and apimgr.imageName need to be the same. This needs to match the image that is in your docker registry.

**mysql.true:** Whether you want mysql enabled or not. If enabled you must have configured MySQL separately before hand, and it must be included in the FED used to build your image

**mysql.hostname:** The address of the MySQL database. This must match the address configured in your FED.

**mysql.databaseme:**  The name of the MySQL database. This must match the name configured in your FED.

**mysql.username:**  The username of the MySQL database. This must match the username configured in your FED.

**mysql.password:** The password of the MySQL database. This must match the password configured in your FED.

**mysql.port:**  The port of the MySQL database. This must match the port configured in your FED.

**mysql.imageTag:**  The version of the MySQL database. This is used to configure the tables in the database. This must match the version of MySQL you have configured.

**mysql.existingSecret:**  The name of a Secret that contains the key 'mysql-password'. The value is the password to use for the mysql.username user. If this is set it will override 'mysql.password'.

**mysql.init:**  If this is 'true' it will run the db-create job. This is required to create the tables in a new db or to reset a db. The default value is 'false'.

**emtDeployment.enabled:** Enabling this allows a user to deploy a FED to a running image. WARNING: This is designed only to be used for testing, never for production. If the container restarts for any reason it will revert to the FED the image was built with.

**cassandra.host0:** The address of the hosts in your cassandra cluster. These must match the port configured in your FED.

### anm
This directory contains all the manifest files related to the Admin Node Manager.

**anm-deployment:** This is defines the anm container. On deployment, this is the first container to start up. If MySQL is enabled, it will validate the database connection is working before starting. If MySQL is not enabled this container will start up straight away.

**anm-service-int:** This service is used for internal communication within the cluster.

**anm-service-ext:** This service is used to expose the the container externally. There are different options, depending on your needs: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types

### apimgmt
This directory contains all the manifest files related to the API Manager UI. This pod handles no Gateway Traffic. We use a separate pod due to the stickiness requirement of the UI.

**apimgmt-statefulset:** This is defines the apimgmt container. On deployment, this container will wait for the anm container to be ready as well as ensuring all cassandra hosts are available before initializing. It will also validate MySQL in the same way the anm container will, if enabled.

**apimgmt-service-int:** This service is used for internal communication within the cluster.

**apimgmt-service-ext:** This service is used to expose the the container externally. There are different options, depending on your needs: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types

### apimgr
This directory contains all the manifest files related to the API Gateway. These pods handle all Gateway Traffic. We run 3 by default, but this can be scaled as needed

**apimgr-deployment:** This is defines the apimgr container. On deployment, this container will wait for the anm and apimgmt containers to be ready as well as ensuring all cassandra hosts are available before initializing. It will also validate MySQL in the same way the anm container will, if enabled.

**apimgr-service-int:** This service is used for internal communication within the cluster.

**apimgr-service-ext:** This service is used to expose the the container externally. There are different options, depending on your needs: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types

### apimgr-oauth
This directory contains the manifest file for the API Gateway Oauth service. This will only work if Oauth is configured in the FED. 

**apimgrOauth--service-ext:** This service is used to expose the the container externally. There are different options, depending on your needs: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types

### mysql
This directory contains files used to configure the MySQL database, if enabled. The database must be configured before hand.

**db-create.yaml:** This Job is used to connect to the database and create the required tables using the configuration defined in the configmap. If MySQL is enabled but the database is not available on the host provided in the values.yaml file, this job will fail.

**mysql-configmap-analytics.yaml:** The configuation used to populate the database in the above Job.

## Deployment
Once the chart is configured and ready to deploy, the namespace to deploy into must first configured. This namespace needs to match what is configured in values.yaml.

`kubectl create namespace "<NAMESPACE>"`


Then, from the repository's home directory, it is wise to do a dry-run ensure there are no issues with the chart:

`helm install --dry-run --debug ./apimgr`


If there are no issues, or after any issues have been fixed you can now install the chart:

`helm install ./apimgr`

Any value listed in the values.yaml file can also be overridden through the command line at run time. For example, in order to override the Admin Node Manager image name you would run the following:

`helm install ./apimgr --set anm.imageName=anm-test-image`


Another values.yaml can also be created with a subset of the values from the default file. This file can then be passed at runtime and it will override only the values it contains, while leaving the rest as what is set in the default file.

`helm install ./apimgr -f dev-environment-values.yaml`

### Validate
Configure port-forwarding for all services

```kubectl port-forward svc/anm-ext 8090:8090
kubectl port-forward svc/apimgmt-ext 8075:8075
kubectl port-forward svc/apimgr-ext 8065:8065
```
These services should then be available on localhost and the corresponding port
